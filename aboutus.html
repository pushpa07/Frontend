                College life is a big transition from school life. We go through a lot of changes when we enter college. Our schools were a safe place where we had grown up and spent half our lives. The transition to college is so sudden that you’re no longer protected
                by your teachers and friends of your school time. College life poses a lot of challenges in front of you. You are now in a place full of unfamiliar faces where you need to mingle in. It teaches us to socialize and form opinions of our
                own. In college, students learn their free will and they go on to become more confident and composed. In school life, we were always dependant on our friends or teachers. College life teaches us to be independent. College life is known
                as one of the most memorable years of one’s life. It is entirely different from school life. College life exposes us to new experiences and things that we were not familiar with earlier. For some people, college life means enjoying life
                to the fullest and partying hard. While for others, it is time to get serious about their career and study thoroughly for a brighter future. It also makes us serious about our careers that will affect our future all . Nonetheless, college
                life remains a memorable time for all of us. Not everyone is lucky enough to experience college life. People do not get the chance to go to college due to various reasons. Sometimes they do not have a strong financial background to do
                so while other times they have other responsibilities to fulfill. The ones who have had a college life always wish to turn back time to live it all once again. The Transition from School Life to College Life College life is a big transition
                from school life. We go through a lot of changes when we enter college. Our schools were a safe place where we had grown up and spent half our lives. The transition to college is so sudden that you’re no longer protected by your teachers
                and friends of your school time.College life experience is truly one of a kind. The most common memories people have of college life are definitely goofing around with friends. They remember how the group of friends walked around the college
                in style and playing silly pranks on each other. Moreover, people always look back at the times spent in the college canteen. It was considered the hub of every student where they enjoyed eating and chatting away with their friends. Another
                college life experience I have seen people cherish the most is the annual fest. The annual fest created so much excitement and buzz amongst the students. Everyone welcomed other colleges with open arms and also made friends there. All
                the competitions were carried out in a good spirit and the students dressed their best to represent their college well.
